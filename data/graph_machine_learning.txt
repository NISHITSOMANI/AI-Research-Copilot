Title: Graph Machine Learning — GNNs, Link Prediction, and Graph Representation Learning

Abstract:
This document introduces graph machine learning with a focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), node/edge/graph prediction, link prediction, graph embeddings, scalability, and applications. It compares popular architectures, training tricks, and deployment considerations.

Introduction:
Graphs represent entities and their relationships. Many real-world problems—recommendation, fraud, molecules, knowledge graphs—are naturally graph-structured. GML learns from topology and attributes to generalize over nodes and subgraphs.

Core Concepts / Methods:
1) Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)
   - Layers aggregate messages from neighbors (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT); update node states.
   - Aggregators: mean/sum/max; attention to weight neighbors; residual and normalization stabilize training.

2) Tasks
   - Node classification/regression, link prediction, and graph classification.
   - Negative sampling for link prediction; contrastive learning for self-supervised pretraining.

3) Expressivity and Oversmoothing
   - 1-WL limitations; positional/structural encodings (LapPE, RWSE) increase expressivity.
   - Oversmoothing and oversquashing in deep GNNs; remedies: residuals, jumping knowledge, dilation.

4) Scalability
   - Sampling: Neighbor sampling, GraphSAINT, Cluster-GCN to train on large graphs.
   - Mini-batching with subgraph extraction; memory-efficient sparse ops; distributed training.

5) Graph Embeddings
   - Node2Vec/DeepWalk for unsupervised embeddings; graph2vec for whole-graph representations.
   - Knowledge graph embeddings (TransE/RotatE/ComplEx) for relational reasoning.

6) Heterogeneous and Dynamic Graphs
   - Metapaths and relation-specific parameters (HAN, R-GCN) for heterogeneity.
   - Temporal GNNs for evolving graphs; event-based models (TGAT, TGN).

Evaluation and Practicalities:
- Metrics: ROC-AUC/PR-AUC for link prediction; accuracy/F1 for node tasks; ROC-AUC for fraud.
- Negative sampling strategies impact performance; ensure realistic train/test edge splits (chronological).
- Robustness: Handle label leakage from structural shortcuts; add attribute noise for stress tests.

Advanced Topics and Practical Guidance:
1) Scaling to Industry Graphs
   - Feature stores for node features; ANN for candidate neighbors; incremental updates.

2) Explainers and Debugging
   - GNNExplainer/PGM-Explainer identify influential subgraphs; sanity-check with counterfactual edges.

3) Hybrid Models
   - Combine GNN encoders with ranking/retrieval heads; two-stage systems in recommenders.

Applications:
- Fraud ring detection, molecule property prediction, knowledge graph completion, social moderation, supply chain risk.

Practical Recipes:
- Start with GraphSAGE + neighbor sampling; add attention for heterogeneity.
- Use link prediction with negative sampling as a pretraining task.
- For dynamic graphs, maintain time-windowed edges and retrain/refresh embeddings on schedule.

Conclusion:
Graph ML brings relational inductive biases that unlock performance on connected data. Success requires scalable sampling, careful evaluation splits, and integration with surrounding data systems.
