---

1) BERT family (encoder-only)
- Objective: masked language modeling (bidirectional context).
- Strengths: text understanding, classification, NER, extractive QA, retrieval rerankers.
- Limitations: not generative out-of-the-box; sequence-to-sequence needs additional head.

2) GPT family (decoder-only)
- Objective: causal LM (left-to-right generation) with large-scale pretraining.
- Strengths: open-ended generation, reasoning, few-shot learning; tool use with plugins/functions.
- Considerations: hallucination risk; RAG and constraints mitigate.

3) T5 family (encoder–decoder)
- Objective: text-to-text with span corruption; task prompted via textual prefixes.
- Strengths: flexible multitask; summarization, translation, QA; strong instruction tuning variants (FLAN-T5).

4) Llama family (decoder-only, open weights)
- Meta's open LLMs (Llama 2/3). Good quality across sizes; strong community fine-tunes for many tasks.
- Strengths: on-prem deployment; customization via LoRA/Adapters; ecosystem support.

5) Falcon (decoder-only)
- TII's Falcon models; strong performance at release; permissive licenses for many use cases.

6) Practical selection
- Understanding/reranking: BERT/RoBERTa, MiniLM.
- RAG generation: Llama/Mistral/GPT variants; pick size based on latency/cost.
- Multitask seq2seq: T5/FLAN-T5.
