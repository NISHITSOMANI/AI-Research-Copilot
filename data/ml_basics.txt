Title: Machine Learning Basics — Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning

Abstract:
This document introduces the three primary paradigms of machine learning—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (RL). It clarifies their objectives, data requirements, representative algorithms, evaluation strategies, and trade-offs, with examples highlighting when to use each approach.

Introduction:
Machine Learning (ML) enables systems to learn patterns from data to make predictions, discover structure, or make decisions. The choice between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning depends on label availability, the task’s objective, and the interaction model with the environment.

Core Concepts / Methods:
1) Supervised Learning
   - Objective: Learn a mapping from inputs X to labels Y.
   - Data: Labeled datasets (e.g., images with class labels, tabular data with target variables).
   - Algorithms: Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, SVMs, k-NN, Neural Networks.
   - Loss/Evaluation: MSE/MAE for regression; cross-entropy for classification; metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC.
   - Examples: Credit default prediction, image classification, demand forecasting.
   - Strengths: Strong performance with sufficient labeled data; clear objective.
   - Limitations: Labeling costs; may not generalize beyond training distribution.

2) Unsupervised Learning
   - Objective: Discover latent structure without labels.
   - Data: Unlabeled datasets; often abundant.
   - Algorithms: k-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE/UMAP (manifold learning), Autoencoders (representation learning).
   - Evaluation: Internal measures (silhouette score), stability, downstream task performance.
   - Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, topic discovery.
   - Strengths: Requires no labels; can reveal novel structure.
   - Limitations: Ambiguous objectives; results can be sensitive to hyperparameters and scaling.

3) Reinforcement Learning (RL)
   - Objective: Learn a policy that maximizes cumulative reward by interacting with an environment.
   - Setting: Agent, states, actions, rewards; often modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
   - Algorithms: Q-learning, SARSA, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic (A2C/A3C), DQN, PPO, SAC.
   - Exploration vs. Exploitation: Strategies like ε-greedy, entropy regularization, Thompson sampling.
   - Examples: Game playing, robotics, adaptive control, dynamic pricing.
   - Strengths: Learns sequential decision-making; handles delayed rewards.
   - Limitations: Sample inefficiency; stability challenges; reward design sensitivity.

Applications:
- Supervised: Medical diagnosis, spam detection, sales forecasting.
- Unsupervised: Market segmentation, fraud outlier detection, dimensionality reduction for visualization.
- RL: Industrial control, recommendation re-ranking, autonomous navigation.

Advanced Topics and Practical Guidance:
1) Data Considerations
   - Label Quality: Noisy labels degrade supervised learning; consider label smoothing, confident learning, or weak supervision.
   - Imbalance: Use class weighting, focal loss, or resampling; evaluate with PR curves and per-class metrics.
   - Feature Leakage: Ensure train/validation splits prevent leakage across time or entities; audit pipelines.
   - Distribution Shift: Monitor covariate and label shift; use domain adaptation or reweighting when possible.

2) Semi-supervised and Self-supervised Learning
   - Semi-supervised: Combine a small labeled set with a large unlabeled set (consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, FixMatch).
   - Self-supervised: Pretrain without labels using contrastive learning (SimCLR, MoCo), masked modeling (MAE, BERT-style) to learn general representations.
   - Benefit: Reduces labeling needs, improves downstream performance, especially under limited labels.

3) Active Learning
   - Strategy: Iteratively query the most informative samples for labeling (uncertainty sampling, query-by-committee, core-set).
   - Use Cases: Medical imaging and legal document review where labeling is expensive.
   - Tip: Combine with human-in-the-loop tooling and robust annotation guidelines.

4) Model Selection and Validation
   - Baselines First: Start with linear models or tree ensembles on tabular data; they are strong baselines.
   - Cross-Validation: Use stratified K-fold for classification; group-aware or time series split when applicable.
   - Hyperparameters: Use Bayesian optimization or bandit-based search (Hyperband) to balance exploration vs. cost.
   - Early Stopping: Monitor validation metrics; avoid overfitting and unnecessary compute.

5) Practical ML Workflow (End-to-End)
   - Problem Framing: Define objective, constraints, and metrics aligned to business impact.
   - Data Pipeline: Build reproducible ETL; add schema and quality checks; version data.
   - Feature Work: Engineer features with domain knowledge; document transformations.
   - Modeling: Benchmark multiple families (linear, tree, neural) and tune.
   - Evaluation: Use holdout and stress tests (shifted distributions, edge cases).
   - Deployment: Package models with inference contracts; ensure monitoring and rollback.
   - Monitoring: Track performance, drift, data integrity; schedule retraining policies.

6) Case Studies
   - Credit Risk (Supervised): Gradient boosting on tabular features with monotonic constraints and explainability (SHAP) to meet regulatory needs.
   - Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised): k-means on behavioral features; evaluate with business experiments; feed segments to marketing.
   - Dynamic Pricing (RL): Contextual bandits for short-term; full RL (PPO) with simulators for long-term optimization.

7) Common Pitfalls
   - Overfitting to Validation: Excessive hyperparameter tuning leaks; use nested CV or a final untouched test set.
   - Data Leakage: Target encodings computed on full data; improper time splits; leaky features.
   - Spurious Correlations: Models key off shortcuts; use counterfactual tests and robustness checks.
   - Misaligned Metrics: Optimizing accuracy when recall or calibration matters more.

8) Comparisons and When to Use What
   - Supervised vs. Unsupervised: If you have labels and a clear task, prefer supervised; use unsupervised to explore and pretrain.
   - RL vs. Supervised: If decisions affect future states and rewards are delayed, consider RL; otherwise supervised is simpler and more sample-efficient.
   - Hybrid: Use self-supervised pretraining on large unlabeled corpora, then fine-tune supervised; use imitation learning to warm-start RL.

Conclusion:
Supervised learning excels when labeled data and clear targets exist; unsupervised learning finds structure in unlabeled data; RL learns to act via trial-and-error. In practice, hybrid approaches—self-supervised pretraining, semi-supervised learning, or RL with imitation learning—often yield the best results. Build robust pipelines with careful validation, monitoring, and human oversight to translate model gains into reliable real-world impact.
