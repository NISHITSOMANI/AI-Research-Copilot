Title: MLOps and Model Deployment â€” Reproducibility, CI/CD, and Monitoring

Abstract:
This document outlines the lifecycle of ML systems from experimentation to production. It covers data/version management, CI/CD for models, model registries, feature stores, serving patterns, monitoring, governance, and reliability engineering.

Introduction:
Moving from notebook to production requires engineering rigor. MLOps aligns data science with DevOps and SRE practices to deliver reliable, auditable, and continuously improving ML services.

Core Concepts / Methods:
1) Reproducibility and Versioning
   - Track datasets, code, models, and environments (DVC/LakeFS, Git, containers, lockfiles).
   - Deterministic pipelines and seeds; lineage and metadata capture for audits.

2) Model Registry and Promotion
   - Register artifacts with metadata, metrics, lineage; manage stages (staging, production, archived).
   - Approval workflows, governance reviews, and rollback plans.

3) Feature Stores
   - Centralized definitions for offline/online parity; point-in-time correctness; data contracts.

4) Serving Patterns
   - Batch scoring, online microservices, stream processing, and on-device inference.
   - Canary releases, blue-green deployments, A/B testing, and shadow traffic.

5) Monitoring and Observability
   - Performance (accuracy, calibration), data drift, concept drift, feature freshness, latency, cost.
   - Tracing and logging; model-specific dashboards; alerting SLOs.

6) Reliability and Safety
   - Guardrails, rate limiting, content filters; fallback policies and circuit breakers.
   - Chaos engineering for ML; disaster recovery and backup strategies.

Advanced Topics and Practical Guidance:
1) Continuous Training (CT) and CI/CD
   - Automate retraining on data arrival; unit/integration tests for features, data, and models.
   - Environment parity across dev/stage/prod; infra-as-code for repeatable deployments.

2) Governance and Compliance
   - Model cards, datasheets; PII handling; access control; audit logs.
   - Risk frameworks (SR 11-7), EU AI Act considerations; bias and fairness evaluations.

3) Cost and Efficiency
   - Autoscaling, right-sizing instances, spot usage; quantization/distillation for serving.
   - Caching, request batching, and asynchronous processing.

Applications:
- Real-time fraud detection, personalization services, forecasting pipelines, document processing.

Practical Recipes:
- Establish a minimal viable MLOps stack: Git + registry + feature store + monitoring.
- Add tests to pipelines; block promotion on validation failures; practice rollbacks.
- Start with canaries and shadow traffic; iterate on monitoring and incident playbooks.

Conclusion:
MLOps operationalizes ML by enforcing reproducibility, safety, and continuous improvement. Well-run ML platforms reduce time-to-value and production risk while enabling rapid iteration.
