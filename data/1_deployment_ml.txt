Title: Production Considerations â€” Latency, Quantization, Caching, Monitoring

Summary: Practical guidance for deploying ML/LLM systems. Discusses latency budgets, model optimization (quantization, distillation), caching strategies, safety, observability, and SLOs.

1) Define product SLOs
- Latency: p50/p95 targets (e.g., p95 < 1s for search, < 3s for chat turn). Budget across steps: retrieval, rerank, generation.
- Availability: error budget and autoscaling policies.
- Quality: groundedness rate, citation accuracy, user satisfaction.

2) Model optimization
- Quantization: int8/int4 with GPTQ/AWQ or ONNX Runtime/QAT; calibrate to minimize loss of quality.
- Distillation: smaller student models mimic teacher outputs; great for rerankers/classifiers.
- Pruning and low-rank adapters for smaller memory footprint.

3) Serving architecture
- Separate stateless API layer from model workers; use task queues and dynamic batching.
- Enable KV cache for decoder LMs; pin models on GPU; use tensor parallelism for large models.
- Route by request type (retrieval-only vs generation vs rerank) to optimized workers.

4) Caching strategies
- Response cache for deterministic prompts; context cache for retrieved chunks; embedding cache for repeated texts.
- Use TTL and versioning; invalidate on corpus updates or prompt template changes.

5) Observability and monitoring
- Collect traces with spans for each stage (ingest, retrieve, rerank, generate).
- Metrics: QPS, latency, GPU/CPU utilization, OOMs, fallbacks, cache hit rate.
- Log prompts/responses with redaction; store provenance (doc ids) for audits.

6) Safety and abuse prevention
- Input filtering for PII/toxicity; rate limiting and abuse detection.
- Guardrails: refusal policies, citation requirements, and post-generation verification.

7) Cost optimization
- Prefer small models with RAG for most queries; escalate to larger models only when necessary (router/gating).
- Batch offline embedding jobs; spot/preemptible instances for non-critical workloads.

8) Testing and rollout
- Canary releases; A/B tests; offline eval suites and red teams.
- Chaos testing for dependency failures (vector DB down, cache cold, model OOM).
