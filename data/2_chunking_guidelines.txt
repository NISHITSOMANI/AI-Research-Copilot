Title: Chunking Strategies and Heuristics for RAG

Summary: Practical approaches to chunking documents for retrieval. Focus on coherence, boundaries, overlap, and metadata to increase retrievability and answer quality.

---

1) Boundary-first
- Prefer splitting at sentence/paragraph/section boundaries; avoid cutting tables, equations, or code blocks mid-entity.

2) Size and overlap
- 150–400 tokens per chunk; adjust by domain. Overlap 10–30% where context continuity matters.

3) Titles and headers
- Attach document title and the closest section header to each chunk for better retrieval.

4) Semantic signals
- Use bullet/heading markers, figure/table captions, and anchor text to preserve meaning.

5) Adaptive strategies
- Short chunks for FAQs and APIs; larger for narratives and legal text.
- Page-aware chunking for PDFs; include page numbers in metadata.

6) De-duplication and quality
- Hash-normalize text; remove boilerplate; de-duplicate near-identical chunks.

7) Evaluation
- Track retrieval metrics as you vary chunk sizes; pick Pareto-optimal settings.
