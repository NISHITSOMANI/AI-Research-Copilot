Title: Knowledge Base Quality Check — Random Sample of 6 Files

Summary: This report documents a quick quality audit across six randomly sampled files. Checks include presence of metadata (Title, Summary, Tags), plagiarism avoidance (no verbatim passages >25 consecutive words from a single source), chunkability (reasonable ~200-word segments ending on sentence boundaries), and citation coverage for major claims.

Tags: quality-check, metadata, plagiarism, chunkability, citations

Sampled Files
- 1_nlp_overview.txt
- 1_faiss_overview.txt
- 1_rag_practice.txt
- 2_retrieval_metrics.txt
- 2_safety_mitigation.txt
- 3_vision_overview.txt

1) Metadata presence
- All six contain Title, Summary, and Tags at the top followed by an '---' separator.

2) Plagiarism check (manual spot-check)
- Content is paraphrased and synthesized. Citations included for foundational claims (e.g., Vaswani et al., FAISS paper, DPR/RAG, safety surveys). No sections appear to copy >25 consecutive words verbatim from any single source.

3) Chunkability review
- Documents are written in bullet/section style with short paragraphs. A naive split every ~200 words will mostly end near sentence boundaries. Where long paragraphs exist, sentences are separated clearly with periods; headings help boundary detection. Recommendation: prefer sentence-aware splitting; if naive split is used, apply a backward scan to the previous period.

4) Citations check
- Major claims and method attributions include citations (e.g., Transformer, LoRA, DPR, BEIR, ROC vs PR). Implementation advice is general knowledge and does not require citations.

5) Length targets
- All sampled Priority 1/2 docs fall within the 300–1,500 word guidance. Priority 3 docs are concise primers.

Notes
- For PDFs or page-derived sources in the future, include .meta.json with provenance (page numbers) as per naming convention.
- Add per-file source lists if expanded with direct quotes; enforce blockquote style and citation if quoting.

Conclusion
- The sampled documents meet the specified quality criteria. Proceed with ingestion. Recommend automated sentence-aware chunking in the pipeline for best results.
