    "Title: Production Considerations — Latency, Quantization, Caching, Monitoring Summary: Practical guidance for deploying ML/LLM systems. Discusses latency budgets, model optimization (quantization, distillation), caching strategies, safety, observability, and SLOs. Tags: deployment, latency, quantization, caching, monitoring, observability, scalability, mlops --- 1) Define product SLOs - Latency: p50/p95 targets (e.g., p95 < 1s for search, < 3s for chat turn). Budget across steps: retrieval, rerank, generation. - Availability: error budget and autoscaling policies. - Quality: groundedness rate, citation accuracy, user satisfaction. 2) Model optimization - Quantization: int8/int4 with GPTQ/AWQ or ONNX Runtime/QAT; calibrate to minimize loss of quality. - Distillation: smaller student models mimic teacher outputs; great for rerankers/classifiers. - Pruning and low-rank adapters for smaller memory footprint. 3) Serving architecture - Separate stateless API layer from model workers; use task queues and dynamic batching. - Enable KV cache for decoder LMs; pin models on GPU; use tensor parallelism for large models. - Route by request type (retrieval-only vs generation vs rerank) to optimized workers. 4) Caching strategies - Response cache for deterministic prompts; context cache for retrieved chunks; embedding cache for repeated texts. - Use TTL and versioning; invalidate on corpus updates or prompt template changes. 5) Observability and monitoring - Collect",

Explains accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC/PR curves, AUCs, class imbalance pitfalls, and common traps. Includes a numeric example demonstrating when ROC-AUC can mislead. Tags: evaluation, metrics, accuracy, precision, recall, f1, roc, pr, auc, imbalanced-data --- 1) Core definitions - Confusion matrix (binary): TP, FP, TN, FN. - Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN). - Precision = TP / (TP + FP): how many predicted positives are correct. - Recall = TP / (TP + FN): how many actual positives are found. - F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). 2) Threshold curves - ROC curve: TPR vs FPR across thresholds; TPR = recall; FPR = FP / (FP + TN). - PR curve: precision vs recall across thresholds; more informative under heavy class imbalance. - AUC-ROC: probability that a randomly chosen positive ranks above a negative. - AUC-PR: area under PR curve; sensitive to prevalence (baseline equals positive rate). 3) When ROC-AUC misleads (numeric example) - Suppose a dataset with 1% positives (100 positives, 9,900 negatives).

    "positive ranks above a negative. - AUC-PR: area under PR curve; sensitive to prevalence (baseline equals positive rate). 3) When ROC-AUC misleads (numeric example) - Suppose a dataset with 1% positives (100 positives, 9,900 negatives). Model A correctly ranks most positives above negatives yielding AUC-ROC=0.95. At a threshold for 80% recall, precision is only 10% (many false positives) → PR-AUC low. - Model B focuses on top precision: at 50% recall, precision is 50%; AUC-ROC might be 0.90 but PR-AUC higher. For rare-event detection, Model B is better despite lower ROC-AUC. 4) Multi-class and averaging - Macro-average: average metric per class; treats classes equally. - Micro-average: aggregate counts over classes; dominated by frequent classes. - Weighted: average weighted by class support. 5) Calibration and decision quality - Calibration measures whether predicted probabilities match observed frequencies (e.g., reliability diagrams, Brier score, ECE). - For decision-making (cost-sensitive), optimize expected utility (e.g., choose threshold to maximize F_beta or net benefit). 6) Metrics for ranking/retrieval - Recall@k, MRR, nDCG; pair with downstream task metrics (answer correctness, groundedness). 7) Best practices - Always report class prevalence and confidence intervals. - Use PR curves for imbalanced problems; supplement ROC with PR. - Report multiple operating points",

Tags: faiss, ann, vector-search, ivf, hnsw, pq, opq, flat, hybrid, similarity --- 1) What is FAISS - A high-performance library for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, optimized for CPU/GPU. - Supports metrics: L2, Inner Product (IP). Cosine is achieved via normalization + IP. 2) Core building blocks - Flat indexes: store raw vectors; exact search; best recall, higher memory/latency. - Quantizers: compress vectors to reduce memory (PQ, OPQ). - Inverted File (IVF): coarse quantization partitions space into nlist clusters, searching only a subset (nprobe clusters) at query time. - Graph-based: HNSW enables fast approximate search via navigable small-world graphs. 3) Common index types - IndexFlatL2 / IndexFlatIP: exact search; good up to ~1–5M vectors depending on RAM/latency targets. - IndexIVFFlat: IVF coarse quantizer + raw vectors in lists; trade recall for speed via nlist/nprobe. - IndexIVFPQ: IVF + Product Quantization; large memory savings with moderate recall loss. - IndexHNSWFlat: graph-based, strong speed–recall trade-off without training. -",

Emphasizes problem framing, data splitting, bias–variance, and when to use each method. Tags: ml, supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement-learning, classification, regression, clustering, basics --- 1) Problem framing - Identify target: regression (continuous), classification (categorical), ranking, structured prediction. - Data splits: train/validation/test; use stratification for classification. - Leakage avoidance: ensure temporal/order splits when applicable; do feature engineering only with train folds. 2) Supervised learning - Linear/Logistic Regression: baselines; interpretable coefficients; regularize with L1/L2/ElasticNet. - Decision Trees: non-linear rules, easy to interpret but overfit without control. - Random Forests: ensembles that reduce variance; robust to outliers and scaling; strong tabular baselines. - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost): top performance on many tabular tasks; tune learning rate, depth, number of trees. - SVMs: margin maximization; kernels for non-linearity; less common at very large scale. - Neural Networks: flexible function approximators; require larger data and careful regularization. 3) Unsupervised learning - Clustering: k-means (requires k), hierarchical (dendrograms), DBSCAN/HDBSCAN (density-based; find arbitrary shapes; handle noise). - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA (linear), t-SNE/UMAP (non-linear for visualization), autoencoders. - Topic Modeling: LDA, NMF; modern alternative: embeddings + clustering.",

    "Title: NLP Overview — Tokenization, Embeddings, and Modern Architectures Summary: This document introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a focus on tokenization approaches, embeddings (static vs contextual), and modern transformer-based architectures such as BERT, GPT, and T5. It clarifies how context is handled, why subword tokenization is standard, and when to prefer different model families. Practical guidance and citations are included. Tags: nlp, tokenization, embeddings, transformers, bert, gpt, t5, context, subword, overview --- 1) What is NLP and why it changed recently - NLP studies how to make computers understand and generate human language. - The deep learning shift (2013–2018) replaced feature engineering with learned representations (word2vec, GloVe) and then transformers. - Transformers enabled scaling, long-range dependency modeling via self-attention, and transfer learning at unprecedented levels. 2) Tokenization: from words to subwords - Word-level tokenization: simple but leads to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues and very large vocabularies. - Character-level tokenization: no OOV, but sequences get long and less semantically meaningful per token. - Subword tokenization (standard): balances vocabulary size and coverage; splits rare words into meaningful pieces. - Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE): merges frequent character pairs into subwords. - WordPiece: similar to BPE, used by BERT. - SentencePiece/Unigram: operates on raw text",

Tags: embeddings, sentence-transformers, similarity, retrieval, semantic-search, normalization, cosine, guidance --- 1) Why sentence embeddings - Represent sentences/paragraphs as dense vectors that capture semantics, enabling semantic search, clustering, deduplication, and RAG retrieval. 2) Model choices and trade-offs - all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-d): excellent balance of speed and quality; default baseline for English. - e5-small / e5-base: trained with instruction-style prompts (\"query:\", \"passage:\") improving retrieval alignment. - multilingual-e5 / LaBSE: multilingual retrieval and cross-lingual search. - Instructor models: allow task-specific instructions at embed time; helpful when queries differ from passages. - Larger models (mpnet-base, bge-large): higher quality but slower; consider for reranking. 3) Tokenization and normalization - Use the model’s provided tokenizer; do not mix tokenizers. - L2-normalize output vectors when using cosine similarity; for dot-product/IP, consider scaling or normalization for stability. 4) Similarity metrics - Cosine similarity is scale-invariant and common for retrieval. - Inner product (dot) is equivalent to cosine if vectors are normalized; faster in many ANN libraries. - L2 distance works but can be sensitive to vector",

    "Drift: monitor embedding norm and similarity distributions over time. 8) Integration with FAISS - Choose metric (IP or L2) to match your similarity; normalize if using cosine. - Start with FlatIP or HNSW for up to ~1–5M vectors; IVFFlat/PQ for larger corpora with recall–latency trade-offs. - Persist metadata externally (JSON/DB) keyed by vector id; or use libraries that co-store it. 9) Common pitfalls - Mixing tokenizers or models between indexing and querying. - Not normalizing vectors when using cosine. - Overly large chunk sizes that dilute semantic focus. - Evaluating only end-to-end without measuring retrieval quality. 10) Minimal pseudo-code (HF Sentence-Transformers) - Load: model = SentenceTransformer(\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\") - Encode: vecs = model.encode(texts, batch_size=64, normalize_embeddings=True) - Search: build FAISS index with metric=IP; query with top_k and rerank if needed.

    "Title: Transformers Overview — Architecture, Attention, and Scaling Laws Summary: A deep dive into transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, encoder/decoder designs, and empirical scaling laws. Includes practical notes on context length, optimization, and inference. Tags: transformers, attention, encoder, decoder, seq2seq, scaling-laws, architecture --- 1) Core architecture - Input embeddings + positional information feed into stacks of attention and feed-forward layers (FFN/MLP) with residual connections and layer normalization. - Multi-Head Self-Attention: splits representation into heads to attend to different subspaces. - FFN: typically two linear layers with activation (GELU/ReLU/Swish); width often 4x hidden size. 2) Encoder vs decoder vs encoder–decoder - Encoder-only: bidirectional self-attention, masked language modeling objective (BERT family). - Decoder-only: causal mask enforces autoregressive generation (GPT/Llama/Mistral). - Encoder–decoder: encoder builds source representation; decoder attends over encoder outputs with cross-attention (T5/BART). 3) Attention mechanics and variants - Scaled dot-product attention with softmax; complexity O(n^2). Variants include: - Sparse/Local Attention (Longformer/BigBird) to extend context efficiently. - Linear/Kernelized Attention (Performer) for approximate O(n) complexity. - ALiBi/RoPE positional methods for long-context extrapolation. 4) Positional encodings - Absolute sinusoidal (original Transformer), learned absolute, relative position biases (DeBERTa), rotary embeddings (RoPE) widely used in decoder LLMs. 5) Training objectives and tricks - Causal LM, Masked LM,",

Curriculum on sequence length. - Optimizers: AdamW with weight decay; learning rate warmup + cosine decay; gradient clipping. - Regularization: dropout, stochastic depth; label smoothing for classification; data noising and augmentation. 6) Scaling laws (Kaplan et al., Chinchilla) - Empirical laws suggest loss scales predictably with compute, data, and model size. - Chinchilla-optimal training keeps model size and data tokens balanced (roughly 20 tokens per parameter order-of-magnitude, details depend on domain). - Implication: for fixed compute, prefer training longer on more data with slightly smaller models. 7) Inference and serving - KV caching drastically reduces per-token latency for autoregressive models. - Quantization (int8/int4) reduces memory and can speed CPU/GPU inference with minimal quality loss when calibrated. - Speculative decoding and beam search/top-p/top-k sampling trade diversity vs quality. 8) Context length and memory - Attention memory scales with sequence length; use flash attention kernels; chunked attention for long sequences. - Retrieval augmentation and tool use can effectively extend",

Tags: chunking, rag, heuristics, overlap, metadata, segmentation --- 1) Boundary-first - Prefer splitting at sentence/paragraph/section boundaries; avoid cutting tables, equations, or code blocks mid-entity. 2) Size and overlap - 150–400 tokens per chunk; adjust by domain. Overlap 10–30% where context continuity matters. 3) Titles and headers - Attach document title and the closest section header to each chunk for better retrieval. 4) Semantic signals - Use bullet/heading markers, figure/table captions, and anchor text to preserve meaning. 5) Adaptive strategies - Short chunks for FAQs and APIs; larger for narratives and legal text. - Page-aware chunking for PDFs; include page numbers in metadata. 6) De-duplication and quality - Hash-normalize text; remove boilerplate; de-duplicate near-identical chunks. 7) Evaluation - Track retrieval metrics as you vary chunk sizes; pick Pareto-optimal settings.

Covers LoRA, adapters, prefix/prompt tuning, and practical recipes for low-GPU settings. Tags: peft, lora, adapters, fine-tuning, transfer-learning, prefix-tuning, prompt-tuning --- 1) Why PEFT - Full fine-tuning updates all parameters (billions), which is compute/memory intensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. - PEFT freezes most weights and learns small additional parameters, retaining base knowledge while reducing cost. 2) LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) - Decomposes weight updates ΔW ≈ A·B with rank r << d, injecting trainable low-rank matrices into attention and MLP layers. - Benefits: orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable params; easy to merge/unmerge; supports composition of multiple LoRAs. - Key hyperparameters: rank r (4–64), alpha (scaling), dropout; target modules (q_proj, v_proj, o_proj, up/down). 3) Adapters - Insert small bottleneck layers within transformer blocks; only adapter params are trained. - Variants: Houlsby and Pfeiffer adapters differ in placement and bottleneck size. - Pros: modular, per-task toggling; Cons: small inference overhead if not merged. 4) Prefix/Prompt Tuning - Learn continuous vectors (virtual tokens) prepended to inputs or key–value states; trainable parameters are small and shared. - Effective for generation tasks where conditioning is crucial. 5) Practical",

It covers causal graphs, identification strategies (back-door, front-door, IV), estimation methods (matching, propensity scores, doubly robust), heterogeneous treatment effects, and practical pitfalls. Introduction: Correlation is not causation. Causal inference seeks to estimate the effect of interventions (treatments) on outcomes under assumptions encoded by a causal model, often represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

    "Title: Efficient Similarity Search with FAISS Abstract: This paper introduces FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. FAISS is optimized for both memory usage and search speed, making it particularly useful for large-scale machine learning applications. We discuss the core algorithms, implementation details, and performance characteristics of FAISS, along with practical examples of its application in various domains. Introduction: Similarity search is a fundamental operation in many machine learning applications, including recommendation systems, image retrieval, and natural language processing. As the size of datasets continues to grow, efficient algorithms for similarity search become increasingly important. Core Algorithms: 1. Inverted File System (IVF): Partitions the vector space into clusters and searches only the most promising clusters. 2. Product Quantization (PQ): Compresses vectors to reduce memory usage while maintaining search quality. 3. Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW): A graph-based approach that provides excellent search performance for high-dimensional data. Implementation Details: FAISS is implemented in C++ with Python bindings, making it both efficient and easy to use. The library supports various index types, including: - Flat indexes for exact search - IVF indexes for faster approximate search - HNSW indexes for very large datasets",
